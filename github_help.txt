[Introduction]
Git is a version control system for code (C Code, latex file, whatever). It allows other people to collaborate on a project. It keeps track of who made what changes, allows you to test ideas and much much more.

Github is a site on which code repositories can be shared for free. To begin:
1) Start here with a tutorial http://help.github.com/ and create an account by following the instructions in "Setup Git". This just allows you to use github.
2) Now we must collaborate on code. This is how it works:
There is one remote master copy of the latex file on github.com. You can make a local copy on your harddisk and modify it. Then you must "push" your changes to the remote repository; i.e., github.com. 
3) To give you access to the remote repository that I have created, do the following: once you've created the SSH keys, and added your public key to your account, please send me your public key so I can give you direct access to the repository. Once I've added your public key, you have remote access to the code. Note that currently creating ssh keys is problematic on office machines in cims. Go to access.cims.nyu.edu and create your ssh keys there.
2) Once you have done this, go to http://help.github.com/ again and read "Fork a Repo". The repository that you will have to clone is github.com:arjunk/Varadhan_Probability_Notes with
    git clone git@github.com:arjunk/Varadhan_Probability_Notes
and a new directory will have been created in your current directory. 
Move to it, create a tex file called "chapter1.tex" and edit away. Once you're done, you MUST send it back to the remote repository that you'll have access to. 

To learn more about git (there's a lot you can do with it), please read the following notes:

[git] 

This is a great book:
http://progit.org/book/ch3-1.html
The link is to chapter 3, which is about branching and explains it quite
nicely. Also added the file to docs. I'll make references to the book using
(chap-section) e.g., (3-2).

* [basic commands] [command list]
git add filename	adds file to repository
git rm filename		removes file from repository
git status		checks for changes
git commit -a -m "msg"	commits changes for everything and include a message
git push (-f)		pushes all files to repository; -f forces the push
git fetch		gets files from repository
git clone		clones repository --command must be made inside directory where you want the clone

* [help]
	git help <command>
always works.

* [ignore]
Include a file called .gitignore with patterns like
	# Ignore itself
	.gitignore
	# Compiles files
	*.[oa]
	*~
	# Editor OS files
	*.swp
To include a global ignore file, you need to add to your config gile
	git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore

* [branches]
The most important part of git is branches. 
	git branches -v
lists all branches and the current HEAD (the pointer to which commit under
which branch is currently active) is listed with an asterix.
	git checkout origin/branchname 
checks out the branch from the server and switches to it. To create a
branchname, type
	git branch n1
	git checkout n1
Or in one step
	git checkout -b n1

** [checking out new branches] [new branches]
When you run git fetch, it will fetch new branches from origin, but it won't
automatically create a local copy for you. So you can merge into your master
branch (say) using
	git merge origin/newbranch
And then push your local master to the newbranch if you please
	git push origin/newbranch

Or, you could create a local copy of the remote branch that tracks changes in
the remote branch. That is, your local and remote branches are linked, when
you do
	git push
it automatically synchronizes the appropriate branches. To do this,
	git checkout -b newbranch origin/newbranch
The -b switch creates the branch "newbranch" and then sets it to "track"
origin/newbranch. (see progit 3-5).

** [tracking]
To do this whole new branch checking out from a remote server, there is an
easy way of doing it:
	git checkout --track origin/n1
This is equivalent to saying, 
	git checkout -b n1 origin/n1

When you do a 
	git clone origin
its like saying
	git checkout --track origin/master

If you didn't clone a remote branch, and you need to set a local branch to track a remote branch, (say master and origin/master) do the following
	git checkout master
	git fetch
	git branch --track origin/master
and it will set the local branch to track the remote branch.

** [pushing] [remote]
	git push <remote> <from local branchname>:<to remote branch name>
	git push origin commentmodule:commentmodule
Or in short,
	git push origin commentmodule
will give the remote branch the same name as the local branch.

** [delete remote] 
To delete the remote branch "n1" after merging in to it's master (say), run
	git push <remote> :n1
(see progit 3-5)

* [config]
There are several configuration files located at 
	/etc/gitconfig
Write to this by typing
	git config --system ...
Also find a local
	~/.gitconfig
write to this by 
	git config --global ...

To list your config type
	git config --list

Commonly set options are
	git config --global user.name "John Doe"
	git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
	git config --global core.editor emacs
A good merging tool is necessary when there are conflicts.
	git config --global merge.tool vimdiff

* [merging] [merge]
Move to the branch you want to merge to; i.e., suppose you've fetched
origin/master and its a few commits ahead. Do
	git branch master
	git merge origin/master
And the master label will be moved ahead to match with origin/master. If
branches have diverged, it will do it from a common ancestor.

* [push]
To push onto a server, do
	git push origin branch1:branch2
meaning, from branch1 to branch2, so really branch1 is allowed to have a
different name, but I wouldn't recommend this. If you want to delete a remote
branch, clearly
	git push origin :branch2
will delete branch2 remotely.

* [tags]
This is useful to give version numbers to commits. Should see (3-6) for this.
Remember that tags have to be explicitly pushed to the server.

* [auto complete]
(3-7) contains information on how to use a bash completion type add on for
git. You probably need to download the git source to be able to do this. 

* [remote] [remotes]
To list all remotes type
	git remote add arjun@acces.cims.nyu.edu
Note that public keys and identity file options cannot be specified from
within git, so you ought to use ~/.ssh/config or /etc/ssh_config for that.
	git remote -v
lists all remotes
	
* [rm] [remove] [git rm]
To remove tracked files use
	git rm file.name
however, this also removes your local copy of the files. Instead use,
	git rm --cached file.nam
which just removes it from the tracked list. To permanently ignore the file,
use
* [.gitignore] [ignore files]
Just append to ~/.gitignore the line
	file.name
and it will ignore the file the next time you type
	git status

* [commit]
Common options include 
	-a automatically add files
But it wont add new directories automatically.
	-m "message"
self explanatory
	-v
Verbose, to include a larger message with diffs and more details
nano editor will open and ask for commit message. Type changes, save, and exit.

** [commit --amend] [amend]
The commit amend must be forced onto the server which prevents it from doing
it normally. This is how it works:
	git commit -m "added file.txt"
but you've actually forgotten to add the file
	git add file.txt
added the file I've forgotten to add and amended the previous thing.
	git commit --amend
which just adds the file and retains the commit message
	git push -f master origin/master
	git push -f <from> <to>
the 2nd line just explains the syntax.
* [filename expansion] [escape character] [globbing]
git does its own globbing for characters like *,? etc. so escape these as
follows:
	git rm docs/\*.log
which removes all log files from the docs directory.
